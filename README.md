Greetings to all! My name is Dmitry. This project contains 5 mini-games inside. Exactly: brain-calc, brain-even, brain-gcd, brain-prime, brain-progression.
To download the game, write the following command:

$ git clone https://github.com/Dmitriy-0891/python-project-lvl1.git

To start the game, you need to run the command in the root folder of the cloned project: 

$ poetry install

$ poetry run <name_game>

The game will ask for your name. 
General rules for all mini-games:
1) you need to answer three times in a row to win.
2) after the first error, the game will automatically end.
