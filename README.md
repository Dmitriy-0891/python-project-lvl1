Greetings to all! My name is Dmitry. This project is the embodiment of a game for the smart. This game contains 5 mini-games inside. Exactly: brain_calc, brain_even, brain_gcd, brain_prime, brain-progression.
To download the game, write the following command:

$ git clone https://github.com/Dmitriy-0891/python-project-lvl1.git

To start the game, you need to run the command: 

$ poetry run game.

The game will ask for your name. After entering the name, you will be asked to play one of the presented mini-games.
You will choose the game. You need to enter the name of the mini-game correctly. Otherwise, the game will apologize and end itself.
General rules for all mini-games:
1) you need to answer three times in a row to win.
2) after the first error, the game will automatically end.
