Greetings to all! My name is Dmitry. This project contains 5 mini-games inside. Exactly: brain-calc, brain-even, brain-gcd, brain-prime, brain-progression.
To download the game, write the following command:

$ git clone https://github.com/Dmitriy-0891/python-project-lvl1.git

To start the game, you need to run the command in the root folder of the cloned project: 

$ poetry install

$ make package-install

$ <name-game> # brain-calc or brain-even or brain-gcd or brain-prime or brain-progression

General rules for all mini-games:
1) you need to answer three times in a row to win.
2) after the first error, the game will automatically end.

Using these links, you can visually see how the game works:
